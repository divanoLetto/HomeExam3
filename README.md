## Introduction

In this problem we solve the Jigsaw Puzzles problem of ordering shuffled patches of an image. <br/>
A nerural network has been created modifying a VGG11 which, given the shuffled images, learns to recognize the permutation and allows to restore the initial image. The problem so has been considered as a classification problem in which it is necessary to distinguish in which of the possible permutations the image has been perturbed. <br\> 
To be able to reach a high level of accuracy starting from the data set provided, an initialization phase of the weights and a phase of data augmentation were carried out.<br\>
Read Report/report.pdf for all the details.

## Usage

In order to use run the code run the following istruction:

```
$ python 3_b.py 
```

The file *settings/config.cfg* contains the project settings as batch size and dataset path.
The following code allows to test the trained network against a never seen dataset by a fine-tuning operations into 9 classes. 

```
$ python 3_c.py 
```
